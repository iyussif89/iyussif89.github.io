##   
My name is Ibrahim Yussif and I have been working as an admistrator for the past two years. My desire has always been to become a cyber security specialist. I am excited I had the opportunity to join Diploma In cyber Security. Even though  I have not yet  had the opportunity to work within this field . But my motivation for completing this program is in two objectives. I am optimistic after this course I would reach my future in Cyber Security. When it comes to the foundation of launching into Cyber Security, I have aquire the skills and knowledge needed to overcome challenges in the Cyber Space. Moreover, this module has also helped me to critically analyse solutions to mitigate online threats. 
Within my portfolio it can be seen that some learning outcomes are stronger than the others. I took this module as an opportuinty to first build my strengths such as time management and interpersonal and also focus on my weakness such as Critical thinking analysis and Problem solving.
